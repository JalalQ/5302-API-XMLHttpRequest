Other additional requirements are as follow:
- only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS can be used to complete the task. No helper functions, libraries, orframeworks are allowed.
- The top right “Crown” icon should only be displayed if the employee is featured
- Each 'role' is given a corresponding color
- Images for employees can be found in http://sandbox.bittsdevelopment.com/code1/employeepics/{id}.jpg

## Method adopted.
Ajax XMLHttpRequest was used to fetch the information from the server. The JS information was then converted into an object, and with the aid of a for loop, the data was displayed with consistent design pattern. CSS was used to render the page according to the mockup.
